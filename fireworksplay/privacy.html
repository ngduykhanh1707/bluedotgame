        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated: April 10, 2025</strong></p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the mobile application <strong>Fireworks Play</strong> (hereinafter referred to as "the App"), developed and operated by <strong>Simplay Studio</strong> (hereinafter referred to as "we," "us," or "our"), the legal entity responsible for the App as listed in the Google Play Store.

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We do not directly collect personal information from you through the App. However, third-party service providers we use to operate and improve the App, as well as features like multiplayer and sharing, may collect certain data on our behalf. The types of information that may be collected include:</p>

            <li><strong>App Activity and Game Progress</strong>: Data about your interactions with the App, such as game progress (e.g., scores, firework shows, mini-game activities like Online Football or Quick Draw Cowboy Gun), session duration, and in-game actions across maps (e.g., Town, West, Samurai, Horror Mansion).</li>
            <li><strong>App Info and Performance</strong>: Crash logs and diagnostics data to help us identify and fix technical issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Device or Other IDs</strong>: Information about your device, such as device name, operating system (e.g., Android version), browser type and language (if applicable), IP address, and mobile device identifiers (e.g., device ID, advertising ID, MAC address, IMEI).</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics Data</strong>: We use third-party analytics tools, such as Unity 3D, to collect anonymized data about App usage. This includes metrics like the number of users, session lengths, and feature usage (e.g., mini-games, firework customization) to help us improve the App.</li>
            <li><strong>Multiplayer Data</strong>: For real-time multiplayer features (e.g., teaming up or competing with friends), we or our service providers may collect data such as player IDs, IP addresses, and game interactions to facilitate online play and ensure a smooth experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.2 User-Generated Content</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Firework Shows and Creations</strong>: When you create and save firework shows using sets, shells, cakes, racks, or other items (e.g., customizable shells like Brocade, Chrysanthemum, or props like Torch, Snow Man), this data may be stored on our servers or those of our service providers. If you choose to share your creations with other players, this content may be associated with a player ID or username (if applicable).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.3 Information You Provide Directly</h3>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We and our third-party service providers use the information collected for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To Provide and Improve the App</strong>: App activity and game progress data are used to save your progress and ensure the App functions properly across its features, including mini-games (e.g., Online Football, Crafting Nuclear Bomb) and maps (e.g., Horror Mansion, Samurai). Crash logs and diagnostics help us identify and fix bugs to improve the App’s performance.</li>
            <li><strong>To Analyze Usage</strong>: Analytics data (via Unity 3D) helps us understand how users interact with the App, allowing us to enhance its design, features (e.g., firework customization, multiplayer modes), and user experience.</li>

            <li><strong>To Store and Share Creations</strong>: User-generated content (e.g., firework shows) is stored to allow you to save, load, and share your creations with other players, enhancing the social and creative aspects of the App.</li>
            <li><strong>To Communicate with You</strong>: If you contact us, we use your provided information (e.g., email address) to respond to your inquiries or provide support.</li>
            <li><strong>To Comply with Legal Obligations</strong>: We may use your information to comply with applicable laws, regulations, or legal requests.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your information to third parties. However, we may share your information in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>With Third-Party Service Providers</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>We share data with third-party providers that help us operate the App, such as:</li>
                    <li><strong>Unity 3D</strong>: For analytics purposes, Unity collects app activity, device information, and performance data (e.g., crash logs) to help us improve the App.</li>
                    <li><strong>Multiplayer Service Providers</strong>: For real-time multiplayer features, our service providers may collect and process player IDs, IP addresses, and game interactions to enable online play.</li>
                    <li>These providers are contractually obligated to protect your data and use it only for the purposes we specify.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>With Other Players</strong>: If you choose to share your firework show creations, this content may be visible to other players and associated with a player ID or username (if applicable).</li>
            <li><strong>For Legal Reasons</strong>: We may disclose your information if required by law, such as in response to a court order, subpoena, or government request.</li>
            <li><strong>In Case of Business Transfers</strong>: If Simplay Studio is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred to the new entity, subject to this Privacy Policy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Retention and Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Retention</strong>: We retain data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. For example:
                <ul>
                    <li>Analytics data collected by Unity 3D is retained for up to 14 months.</li>
                    <li>Multiplayer data (e.g., game interactions) is retained for up to 6 months to ensure a smooth online experience.</li>
                    <li>User-generated content (e.g., saved firework shows) is retained until you delete it or your account (if applicable) is inactive for 2 years.</li>
                    <li>Support-related communications (e.g., emails) are retained for up to 2 years.</li>
                </ul>
                After these periods, we delete or anonymize the data.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Security</strong>: Data is encrypted in transit to protect it from unauthorized access during transmission. We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to safeguard your information, including multiplayer data and user-generated content. However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Note</strong>: We do not provide a mechanism for you to request data deletion because the App does not collect personally identifiable information. Data collected by third parties (e.g., Unity) or shared with other players (e.g., firework shows) is managed according to their retention policies or your sharing preferences.</p>

        <h2>5. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Multiplayer Features</strong>: You can choose whether to participate in multiplayer modes. If you opt in, your player ID, IP address, and game interactions will be shared with our service providers to enable real-time play.</li>
            <li><strong>Sharing Creations</strong>: You can choose whether to share your firework show creations with other players. If you share, this content may be visible to others and associated with a player ID or username (if applicable).</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics</strong>: The App uses Unity 3D for analytics, which collects anonymized data. You cannot opt out of this data collection, as it is necessary for the App’s operation and improvement. However, no personally identifiable information is collected.</li>
            <li><strong>EU/EEA Residents (GDPR)</strong>: If you are in the European Union or European Economic Area, you have rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), including the right to access, rectify, or erase your data, and the right to object to or restrict processing. Since we do not collect personally identifiable information, we may not have any data to provide or delete. Contact us for assistance.</li>
            <li><strong>California Residents (CCPA)</strong>: If you are a California resident, you have rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), including the right to know what data we collect and to request deletion. Since we do not collect personally identifiable information, we may not have any data to provide or delete. Contact us for assistance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>Fireworks Play is a family-friendly game suitable for all ages, but it is not specifically designed to target children under the age of 13 (or 16 in the EU/EEA). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under this age. The App does not require users to provide personal information, and the data collected by third parties (e.g., Unity 3D) or for multiplayer features is anonymized or limited to gameplay data (e.g., scores, firework shows) and used solely for analytics, performance improvement, and online play.</p>
        <p>If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 (or 16 in the EU/EEA) without parental consent, we will delete it promptly. If you believe a child under this age has provided us with personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@simplaystudio.com">contact@simplaystudio.com</a>.</p>

        <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App integrates with third-party services, such as Unity 3D for analytics and multiplayer service providers for real-time online play. These services may have their own privacy policies, and we are not responsible for their practices. We encourage you to review their policies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unity 3D</strong>: For information on Unity’s data practices, please review their privacy policy at <a href="https://unity3d.com/legal/privacy-policy">Unity Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Note</strong>: Multiplayer functionality may involve additional third-party services for hosting online play. These providers are selected to ensure data protection, but we recommend reviewing their privacy policies if available.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We will notify you of significant changes by posting the updated policy on this page (<a href="https://bluedotgame.com/fireworksplay/privacy.html">https://bluedotgame.com/privacy-fireworks.html</a>) and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
