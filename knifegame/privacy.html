        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We do not directly collect personal information from you through the App. However, third-party service providers we use to operate and improve the App may collect certain data on our behalf. The types of information that may be collected include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>App Activity and Game Progress</strong>: Data about your interactions with the App, such as game progress (e.g., scores, levels completed in Classic, Audition, Timer, or Memory modes), session duration, and in-game actions.</li>

            <li><strong>Device or Other IDs</strong>: Information about your device, such as device name, operating system (e.g., Android version), browser type and language (if applicable), IP address, and mobile device identifiers (e.g., device ID, advertising ID, MAC address, IMEI).</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics Data</strong>: We use third-party analytics tools, such as Unity 3D, to collect anonymized data about App usage. This includes metrics like the number of users, session lengths, and feature usage to help us improve the App.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.2 Information You Provide Directly</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Support Communications</strong>: If you contact us directly (e.g., via email at <a href="mailto:contact@simplaystudio.com">contact@simplaystudio.com</a> for support), we may collect the information you provide, such as your email address and any details included in your message.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>1.4 In-App Purchases</h3>
        <p>The App offers in-app purchases (e.g., items priced between ₫69,000 - ₫115,000). These transactions are processed by the Google Play Store, and we do not collect or store your payment information. Google Play’s privacy policy applies to these transactions.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>To Provide and Improve the App</strong>: App activity and game progress data are used to save your progress and ensure the App functions properly across its modes (Classic, Audition, Timer, Memory). Crash logs and diagnostics help us identify and fix bugs to improve the App’s performance.</li>
            <li><strong>To Analyze Usage</strong>: Analytics data (via Unity 3D) helps us understand how users interact with the App, allowing us to enhance its design, features, and user experience.</li>
            <li><strong>To Support In-App Purchases</strong>: We use device information to facilitate in-app purchases through the Google Play Store.</li>
            <li><strong>To Communicate with You</strong>: If you contact us, we use your provided information (e.g., email address) to respond to your inquiries or provide support.</li>
            <li><strong>To Comply with Legal Obligations</strong>: We may use your information to comply with applicable laws, regulations, or legal requests.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Note</strong>: The App does not currently display ads. If we introduce ads in the future, we will update this policy to reflect how ad-related data is used.</p>

        <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your information to third parties. However, we may share your information in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>With Third-Party Service Providers</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>We share data with third-party providers that help us operate the App, such as:</li>
                    <li><strong>Unity 3D</strong>: For analytics purposes, Unity collects app activity, device information, and performance data (e.g., crash logs) to help us improve the App.</li>
                    <li><strong>Google Play Services</strong>: For in-app purchases, Google Play may collect device information to process transactions.</li>
                    <li>These providers are contractually obligated to protect your data and use it only for the purposes we specify.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>For Legal Reasons</strong>: We may disclose your information if required by law, such as in response to a court order, subpoena, or government request.</li>
            <li><strong>In Case of Business Transfers</strong>: If Simplay Studio is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred to the new entity, subject to this Privacy Policy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Retention and Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Retention</strong>: We retain data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. For example:
                <ul>
                    <li>Analytics data collected by Unity 3D is retained for up to 14 months.</li>
                    <li>Support-related communications (e.g., emails) are retained for up to 2 years.</li>
                </ul>
                After these periods, we delete or anonymize the data.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Security</strong>: Data is encrypted in transit to protect it from unauthorized access during transmission. We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to safeguard your information. However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Note</strong>: We do not provide a mechanism for you to request data deletion because the App does not collect personally identifiable information. Data collected by third parties (e.g., Unity) is managed according to their retention policies.</p>

        <h2>5. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>In-App Purchases</strong>: You can choose whether to make in-app purchases. These are optional and processed by Google Play.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics</strong>: The App uses Unity 3D for analytics, which collects anonymized data. You cannot opt out of this data collection, as it is necessary for the App’s operation and improvement. However, no personally identifiable information is collected.</li>
            <li><strong>EU/EEA Residents (GDPR)</strong>: If you are in the European Union or European Economic Area, you have rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), including the right to access, rectify, or erase your data, and the right to object to or restrict processing. Since we do not collect personally identifiable information, we may not have any data to provide or delete. Contact us for assistance.</li>
            <li><strong>California Residents (CCPA)</strong>: If you are a California resident, you have rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), including the right to know what data we collect and to request deletion. Since we do not collect personally identifiable information, we may not have any data to provide or delete. Contact us for assistance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Note</strong>: The App does not currently serve ads. If we introduce ads in the future, we will provide options to opt out of personalized ads through your device settings.</p>

        <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>Knife Finger Game is rated for ages 3+ on the Google Play Store, but it is not specifically designed to target children under the age of 13 (or 16 in the EU/EEA). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under this age. The App does not require users to provide personal information, and the data collected by third parties (e.g., Unity 3D) is anonymized and used solely for analytics and performance improvement.</p>
        <p>If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 (or 16 in the EU/EEA) without parental consent, we will delete it promptly. If you believe a child under this age has provided us with personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@simplaystudio.com">contact@simplaystudio.com</a>.</p>

        <h2>7. Responsibilities and Safety Disclaimer</h2>

However, we strongly advise against attempting this game in real life with a knife or any sharp object.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User Responsibility</strong>: You are responsible for your own health and safety. We do not take responsibility for any harm to your mental or physical health caused by playing the App or attempting the game in real life.</li>
